website is a combination of apps.
python manage.py startapp <name_of_app>
django is a model view controller. urls.py is the controller
admin.site is its own app
jinja is python templating framework like html	 
{% %} jinja logic
{{var}} jinja variables
bootstrap provides style sheets (css) for frontend development.
Content Delivery Network (CDN) helps websites load faster.
django merges templates and static files for all apps.
Hence better to store these files under personal/static/personal/file to avoid conflicts for same names.
